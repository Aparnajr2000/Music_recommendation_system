**Project Overview:**

A music recommendation project that uses clustering to categorize music genres based on audio characteristics. 
We're using a Kaggle dataset that includes popular Spotify songs as well as audio feature information for each one.

**Goals:** To identify similarities between these audio features and categorize music genres based on those similarities. 
This way, we can recommend music that users are likely to like!"
