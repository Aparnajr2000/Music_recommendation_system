# Music_recommendation_system
**Project Overview:**

A music recommendation project that uses clustering to categorize music genres based on audio characteristics. 
We're using a Kaggle dataset that includes popular Spotify songs as well as audio feature information for each one.

**Goals:** To identify similarities between these audio features and categorize music genres based on those similarities. 
This way, we can recommend music that users are likely to like!"

**Data Source:**

First thing after importing the data is to check how many rows and columns exist. The info command gives us an overview of the columns, their data types as well as if they have any null values.

Once we have an idea of the number of rows and columns we have we can determine if we can drop any rows, or we might need to repopulate them in case of null or extreme values.
